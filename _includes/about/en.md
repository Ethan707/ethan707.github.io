Hi, I am Yuxi(Ethan) Chen, a university student with passion in computer science.

I feel interested in many things, machine learning, big data, data visualization, and...front-end ðŸ˜ƒ

Very happy to meet you guys here. I will record all my thoughts, confusion, and experiences. I would love to go into research in the related fields of artificial intelligent and machine learning.

I hope I can use my blog to write these things down.

Hope you enjoy reading, thank you ðŸ˜‰
