## Hi

> ‚ÄúGame start‚Äù

Ethan's Blog is built.

To be honest, I am a lazy person who love to explore something interesting.

I can put my mind on something and focus on it for several weeks (if I am still interested in it).

But the biggest problem is when I could no longer feel excited, I will quit it halfway through.

I hope I can develop the habit of sticking to something. Thus, I build this blog.

> Naughty boy: I afraid you will forget this blog very soon üòí
> Me: Shut up !!!

In fact, I tried to build this blog several months age. But I felt too difficult at that time (Actually not). So, I just made a semi-finished product at that time. Now I am back to finish it and make it better.

Oh, there is an important person: my friend [Robert](https://www.robertj1.com/) (Actually we haven‚Äôt said a few words or met each other).

He is a really talented and smart guy and has won many award. What surprised me was that he was even the founder of the Google Developer Student Clubs of the University of Alberta. He managed his time efficiently.

Many of his deeds have certain reference significance, and I think I can learn a lot from him. Thus, I want to use this blog to record my growth.

Let's talk something about the experience of building this blog.

## The Blog Building Experience

In fact, I forgot how I find this blog theme. Maybe from GitHub's recommendation , since I often starred repositories that looks great.

The build process is not very smooth. The problems I encountered include but are not limited to:

* Version problems
* Network problems (the source of ruby gem)
* The resolution of the icon
* The slow website connection
* ...

Most of them is the small problems but fixing they do make you tired. Sometime you needed to spend a lot of time just to fix one of them.

But its advantages are very obvious:

* Markdown: elegant and simple. *My best language* (just kiddingüòÅ)
* Git Workflow: perfect synchronization
  * what you need to do just `push` and `pull`
* Free to use and unlimited space
* Free online viewing

Actually this workflow is really convenient for me, and I am also very familiar with it.
Because I used to use the git and markdown to take course notes.

Ignore these annoying problems, the rest of the process is very simple

* Install `Ruby` and `Bundle`
* Install `Jekyll`
* Modify the basic information, like name, images, links...
* Push to the GitHub

## Finally

I hope we can meet more times in the futureüòÅ
