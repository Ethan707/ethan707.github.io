<!-- ## Introduction -->

> This my first machine learning project, or a lab. Anyway :)

## Dataset

In this project, we use the [google kaptcha](https://code.google.com/archive/p/kaptcha/) to generate the captcha data.

You can choose to download the generator, or you can also use the dataset I uploaded.

Captcha generator: [Github(coming soon)]()
